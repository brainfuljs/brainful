# Thinking

Something to think about.

To ensure the efficient operation of your application, you will need to undertake significant work.  
You have all the tools necessary for reactivity and effective state updates.
Utilizing an IoC container will give you control over dependencies in the project.
By following the recommendations and best practices of OOP and design patterns,
you will write loosely coupled code and enhance your architectural thinking.
Additionally, adhering to the principles and concepts of functional programming will result in well-designed low-level code.

Take a small step on the way from a framework developer to a real front-end engineer.
