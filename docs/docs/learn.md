Brainful - a brain full of knowledge.

Brainful is a lightweight library designed for building user interfaces.  
It contains only a few core classes that determine when a component needs to be re-rendered, everything else is up to you.

Brainful is not yet ready for production use, it serves as a playground for learning powerful instruments.

You will need to use the power of:

- OOP Principles and Design Patterns for good architecture.
- [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/) for reactivity.
- [Immutable](https://immutable-js.com/) for efficient data management.
- [Inversify](https://inversify.io/) for inversion of control.
- [Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/) for Functional Programming.
- [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) for template processing.
